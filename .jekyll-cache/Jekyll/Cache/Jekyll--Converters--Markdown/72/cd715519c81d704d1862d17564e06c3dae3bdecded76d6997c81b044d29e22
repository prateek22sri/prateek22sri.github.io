<p><strong>Feld Programmable Gate Arrays (Verilog, VHDL)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a floating-point unit for a Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA board (VCU118)</li>
  <li>Implemented a hardware implementation of a feed-forward Convolutional Neural Network called XNOR-Net which has faster execution due to the replacement of vector-matrix multiplication to ‚ÄúXNOR + Pop-count‚Äù operation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High Performance Computing (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, C/C++)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>(Master‚Äôs Thesis) Conducted a comparative analysis on scaling results for graph algorithms like single source shortest path (SSSP) algorithm using multiple runtime systems thereby reducing time to solution for graph processing with a message driven runtime system (like Charm++) or Graph500</li>
  <li>Created a parallel variant of a graph algorithm (Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm) using OpenMP on a Cray machine (XE6/XK7) and performed the benchmarking for single node up to 32 processing units.</li>
  <li>Implemented parallel programs, performance benchmarking, latency reduction and resource contention resolution. Used Perf and VampirTrace.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Natural Language Processing (C++, Python, NLTK, SciKit)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed an artificial intelligence bot capable of doing natural language processing. The application can store information with simple English sentences and is also capable of answering questions with keyword search about the information already stored in the system. The technologies used were Alexa Skills Kit, SpaCy, core NLP, Stardog, and Neo4J</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Machine learning &amp; Deep learning (Python, SciKit)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Built a genre detection tool for text using lexical and statistical (machine learning) techniques, including dependency parsing, bigram models, deep learning constructs like CNN and RNN, ensemble approach with multiple weak-voting classifiers, and support vector machine</li>
  <li>Created an image orientation detection tool by finding k-nearest neighbors on the test image using adaptive boosting model</li>
  <li>Coded a chess playing engine using heuristic based minimax with alpha-beta pruning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advanced Operating Systems: Embedded OS Development in C (C, UNIX, XINU, LINUX)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Created system calls and augmented the embedded OS at different levels of abstraction such as Threading and Synchronization, scheduler, memory management, hybrid cache replacement policies, interrupt handler, drivers, network protocols and file system.</li>
  <li>Conceptualized and implemented Semaphores &amp; Futures, a process synchronization mechanism using FIFO queue.</li>
</ul>
