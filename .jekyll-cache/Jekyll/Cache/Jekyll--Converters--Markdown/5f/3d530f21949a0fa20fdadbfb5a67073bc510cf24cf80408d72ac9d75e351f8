<ul>
  <li>Built the ‚ÄúGuesser Module‚Äù which predicted the typographical errors or missing words along with their semantic meaning by using Deep Semantic parsing considering the position of the words, bigram models along with the probabilistic models of Machine learning like tf-idf, regression, bag of words, and k-nearest neighbors - FLE</li>
  <li>Built Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Networks to use machine learning for deep semantic comprehension and predictions of unknown words.</li>
  <li>Free Linguistic Environment (FLE) is an open source grammar engineering platform for the Lexical Functional Grammar framework. http://www.gorilla.linguistlist.org/fle/</li>
