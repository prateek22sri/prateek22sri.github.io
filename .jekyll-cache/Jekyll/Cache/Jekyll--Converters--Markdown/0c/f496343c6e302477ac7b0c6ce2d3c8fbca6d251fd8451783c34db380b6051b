<ul>
  <li>Built a dynamic delay unit emulator called “Logic in-Memory Emulator (LiME)” on a Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC FPGA (Fidus Sidewinder or ZCU102) that allowed engineers in the U.S. Department of Energy  to model(emulate) current and future memory systems as well as near memory accelerators</li>
  <li>Got only 20x slower speeds than real time (orders of magnitude faster than typical simulators) execution</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Engineered a test infrastructure for a cycle-accurate FPGA based simulator for a non-Von Neumann general-purpose computer called Continuum Computer Architecture</li>
  <li>Experimented with various interfaces for host to programmable logic (PCIe), processing system to programmable logic (AXI buses), and programmable logic to programmable logic (QSFP28), to incorporate it in the testing infrastructure for maximum performance</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="research-intern--kelley-school-of-business--dept-of-linguistics-prof-damir-cavar-indiana-university-nov-2016--may-2017">Research Intern | Kelley School of Business &amp; Dept. of Linguistics (Prof. Damir Cavar), Indiana University	Nov 2016 – May 2017</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Developed and open sourced Free Linguistic Environment (FLE), a grammar engineering platform for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) framework, on a team of 4 engineers and 2 data scientists</li>
  <li>Built the “Guesser Module” from scratch which predicted the typographical errors or missing words along with their semantic meaning by using Deep Semantic parsing considering the position of the words, bigram models along with the probabilistic models of machine learning like Tf-idf, regression, bag of words, and k-nearest neighbors</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="systems-engineer--tata-consultancy-services-india-feb-2013--jun-2016">Systems Engineer | Tata Consultancy Services, India	Feb 2013 – Jun 2016</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Designed, developed, and maintained the data warehouses for multiple domains like payroll, treasury, and oil and gas that averaged 5TB in total size for General Electric US</li>
  <li>Improved query run times for multi-dimensional analysis by 12% on average and 10% faster view generation time</li>
  <li>Automated ETL processes using Informatica PowerCenter Client Tool and shell scripts, revamped the data warehouse, and automated the process to transform large volumes of data while handling major responsibilities such as client interaction, source control, integration testing and server deployment</li>
</ul>
