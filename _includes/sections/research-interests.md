My research interests are essentially High-Performance Computing - Continuum Computing, Natural Language Processing and Quantum Computing. My major work is with Parallel Graph Processing Algorithms and I am working towards designing the architecture of an Exascale Graph Processing Machine. I also work with deep semantic parsing using Graph Database and Knowledge Representation using Exascale Machines in the field of High-Performance Natural Language Processing.
