#### Instructor | Intelligent Systems Engineering, Indiana University | Jun 2019 - Jul 2019
+ Designed and taught an online summer course on “software systems engineering” with C

#### Summer Intern | (Dr. Maya Gokhale) Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Livermore, California | May 2018 - Aug 2018
+ Built a dynamic delay unit for Logic in-Memory Emulator (LiME) which allowed users to model(emulate) current and future memory systems as well as near memory accelerators
+ Developed the dynamic delay unit in LiME on a Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC FPGA (Fidus Sidewinder or ZCU102) to get cycle accurate emulations with only 20x slower than real time execution speeds. 

#### Research Assistant | (Prof. Thomas Sterling) Intelligent Systems Engineering, Indiana University	| May 2018 – Present
+ Prototyping computing cells embedded in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) by designing proof-of-concept for non-von Neumann computer architecture along with its instruction set architecture
+ Engineering a test-infrastructure for the same non-Von Neumann architecture and experimenting with various interfaces for host to programmable logic (PCIe), processing system to programmable logic (AXI buses), and programmable logic to programmable logic (QSFP28), to incorporate it in the testing infrastructure with maximum performance

#### Research Assistant | (Prof. Thomas Sterling) Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies, Indiana University | Jun 2017 – May 2018
+	Worked primarily in exploration of dynamic and static parallel graph algorithms
+	Improved time to solution for a graph problem called single source shortest path algorithm using parallel boost graph library, MPI, and OpenMP
+	Explored message driven runtime systems such as Charm++, and Graph500 for parallel graph processing

#### Intern | Kelley School of Business & Dept. of Linguistics (Prof. Damir Cavar), Indiana University	| Nov 2016 – May 2017
+	Built the “Guesser Module” which predicted the typographical errors or missing words along with their semantic meaning by using Deep Semantic parsing considering the position of the words, bigram models along with the probabilistic models of Machine learning like tf-idf, regression, bag of words, and k-nearest neighbors - FLE
+ Built Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Networks to use machine learning for deep semantic comprehension and predictions of unknown words.
+	Free Linguistic Environment (FLE) is an open source grammar engineering platform for the Lexical Functional Grammar framework. http://www.gorilla.linguistlist.org/fle/

#### Systems Engineer | Tata Consultancy Services, India | Feb 2013 – Jun 2016
+	Worked with GE as part of Center of Excellence (COE) team for data management and integration. Designed, developed and maintained the data warehouses for multiple domains like payroll, treasury, and oil & gas
+	Developed and automated the process to transform large volumes of data to maintain the data warehouse using shell scripts and Informatica PowerCenter Client Tool and handled major responsibilities such as client interaction, source control, unit testing and server deployment.
